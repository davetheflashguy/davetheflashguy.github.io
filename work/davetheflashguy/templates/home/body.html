	    <p>Dave Collier Consulting was founded in 2011 by its Owner and CTO Dave Collier.  Dave comes from a long line of big media and engineering experience; formally of Clear Channel Communications, Rockstar Games, National Basketball Association, and MTV.  He went out on his own and founded the company in an effort to get away from the typical office job as well as the typical media delivery engineering nich√®.<br /><br />The company's focus has mainly been in the mobile application space with a focus in the health and medical industry.  We've been working closely with clients such as Wolters Kluwer and HealthiNation, while still facilitating our big data and media clients such as Verizon and Guavus.<br />
